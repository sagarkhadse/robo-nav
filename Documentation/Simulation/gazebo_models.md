# Gazebo Models

> Work in progress...

Most models are directly available as a part of [gazebo_models](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models) repository. 

## Microsoft Kinect

1. Make sure `openni` is installed. 
2. Acquire the Kinect model from [gazebo_models/kinect](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models/tree/master/kinect).
3. Copy the kinect folder to `~/.gazebo/models` directory.
